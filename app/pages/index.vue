		</ul>
		<p>
			big or small, web, game or cli - doesn't matter. if it sounds fun or useful, i'll do it
		</p>
		<p>
			personally, i enjoy creating user-facing stuff that someone can interact with or creating complicated logic that make me feel smart<br>
			despite that, i understand that not all of programming can be exciting and sometimes a job needs to get done. i'm here for those times too
		</p>
		<h3>experience</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>4 years of polish <i>technikum</i> (a vocational IT school), in the middle of which i started freelance work</li>
			<li>internship that turned into 4 years of junior, then mid fullstack web developer position</li>
			<li>? - excited for what future holds</li>
		</ol>
		<h5>web dev</h5>
		<p>
			if it's javascript, html or css related i will be fine, regardless of the framework and tools. That said, i prefer Vue and use it a lot with Nuxt and tailwind (unocss). I can handle a typescript backend, whether it's using an ORM or pure SQL/Mongo, and 3rd-party integrations. I have written tests with Jest then migrated them to Vitest and rewritten a codebase from cjs to esm
		</p>
		<p>
			besides implementing the designs pixel-perfect, i do my best to make sure my websites meet the a11y standards, are responsive and fully keyboard navigable. I would like to explore making a website fully screen reader friendly but unforunately it's a very time consuming process and i haven't had the chance to do so. To anybody interested in accessibility i wholeheartedly recommend <NuxtLink target="_blank" to="https://adrianroselli.com/">

		</p>
		<h5>not web dev</h5>
		<p>
			my mindset is that given enough time i'll figure it out. Sooner rather than later, it's all programming after all. I enjoy finding new ways of doing things and programming languages are really good at providing them. I know what Rust, Python and PHP look like and i feel like i wouldn't be <i>that</i> lost amidst Java decorators or Lua's 1-based indexing.
		</p>
		<p>
			git for version control and a decent knowledge of what to do with branches, pull requests and commits. I'm familiar with creating/maintaining Github CI/CD pipelines, as well as making and using Docker containers. I use Neovim btw. Additionally i have experience with video editing
